Polymorphism in C++:
Types:
1. Compile-Time Polymorphism : 
    In compile-time polymorphism, it is already known which function will run. Compile-time polymorphism is also called early binding, which means that you are already bound to the function call and you know that this function is going to run.
    
    1.1 - Function Overloading
    1.2 - Operator Overloading

2. Run-Time Polymorphism :
    In the run-time polymorphism, the compiler doesnâ€™t know already what will happen at run time. Run time polymorphism is also called late binding. The run time polymorphism is considered slow because function calls are decided at run time. Run time polymorphism can be achieved from the virtual function.
