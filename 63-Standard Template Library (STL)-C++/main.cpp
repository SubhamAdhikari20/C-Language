/*
STL ----> Contains well tested classes and functions / components
"""STL is used because like 'we don't invent the tools that are already created' so, our main aim is to use already created and maintained STL efficiently"""

STL is for competitive programming  ----> For reusing well tested classes and functions / components which saves a lot of time and maintains readibility

Components of STL:
1. Containers ----> As the name suggests, Object that "stores data" Ex: vector
        `---------> Uses tempalte classes

2. Algorithms ----> Steps taken to solve problems OR, set of procedures to manipulate 
      \             structured data to come to conclusions / procedures to process data. Ex: 
       \            sorting arrays, searching, merging
        `---------> Uses templates functions

3. Iterators -----> Object that points to an element in a cointainer
       `----------> handled just like pointers but are actually objects
       `----------> connects algorithms with cointainer and helps in data manipulation
