Containers:
1. Sequence Containers ----> stores data in linear fashion. Ex: Vector, List, Dequeue
    -Vector:
     ----> random access is fast
     ---->insertion/deletion at the middle is slow
     ---->insertion/deletion at the end is fast
    
    -List:
     ----> random access is slow
     ---->insertion/deletion at the middle is fast
     ---->insertion/deletion at the end is slow
    
2. Associative Containers ----> direct/faster access to an element. Ex: set, multi-set, map, multi-map
     ----> random access is slow
     ---->insertion/deletion at the middle is fast
     ---->insertion/deletion at the end is fast

3. Derived Containers ----> real world modelling. Ex: stack, queue, priority-queue
    ----> Depends --> Data Structure
    - stack ----> LIFO(Last In First Out) data sturcture 
    - queue ----> FIFO(First In First Out) data sturcture
